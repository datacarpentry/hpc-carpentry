# hpc-carpentry
Information on training for High Performance and High Throughput computing, which
includes HPCs, but also any remote resource that enables high throughput computing. 

In this repository we're 

- [collecting information on available resources in HPC training](https://github.com/datacarpentry/hpc-carpentry/wiki/Training-Resources)
- [generating ideas about what should be taught in an 'Intro to High Throughput computing' module](what-to-teach.md)
- [organizing people interested in contributing](https://github.com/datacarpentry/hpc-carpentry/issues/3) to these discussions or development
- starting drafts of lessons 

If you are interested in being a part of the discussion about the development
of these resources, please subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/datacarpentry/hpc-carpentry/issues/3)
